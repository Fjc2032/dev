Changelog 6/17
Imperium Combat Update (BETA)

New bosses and combat mechanics are now available
The following bosses are available:
Hasty Goblin (miniboss)
Strengthened Ravager (miniboss)
Terminator
Evolved Inferno
Vorpal Spirit Master
Elemental Water Fairy (advanced)
For now, spawning a boss requires you to complete a boss quest (they are in the bottom 2 tiles in /quests). You'll receive a spawn egg which allows you to spawn the boss anytime. More boss information also exists at the bottom of the GUI in /quests.
Some bosses are harder than others, and may not be beginner friendly. Don't expect all the bosses to be a cakewalk.
There are also new custom items that can be obtained from killing these bosses. Most notably, the Hasty Goblin Pickaxe, Bloodied Axe, and Sylvetta Longbow. These items have custom mechanics that allow for much greater damage distribution if used correctly. More detailed information on these items will be available soon.

Remember that this system is still in beta and may suddenly change
Some other changes:
- Totems, ender pearls, signs, and minecarts are now stackable (8, 32, 32, 16 respectively)
- Fixed a bug where some pets would itemstack on themselves
- Fixed an issue with quests that would prevent rewards
- AFK status is now shown as a suffix on tab
- Obsidian Trident chance in obsidian crate was reduced

Known Bugs:
- Some bosses may randomly disappear [mostly fixed, elemental water fairy may still do this since it's based on a passive mob]
- Boss egg is lost if inv is full
- Some players lose access to /god after killing a boss (usually happens when player abandons boss instead of killing)
- Players without Emperor gain access to /god after killing a boss [fixed]
- Quest resetting still not working
- Vorpal Spirit Master boss drains durability at an unreasonable rate
- Hasty Goblin fireball not working correctly
- Dragon pet is not working

Planned Changelog:

Things that are currently happening:

- Implement new /ranks method for 1.21
  - Since the TabuuCore API (we use this backend for managing permissions and perks) most likely isn't getting an update anytime soon, I have decided to take an alternate
  approach to fill the looming gap that is /ranks. Hopefully this method works out.
- New train models and train systems
  - Me and Rat (mostly Rat) are planning to add brand new models to minecarts, as well as the possibility of aircraft.
- Push to 1.21.1
  - I really _reallllly_ would love to push Imperium to Minecraft 1.21.1 (1.21.3 is already out but it's whatever).
  Unfortunately compatibility is another problem that's been killing us for a while. Some things just don't port over that easily.
  Thanks Mojang. From our testing, features most likely to stop working on a 1.21.1 update are
    - Scoreboard
    - /ranks (fix being implemented)
    - BetterAlias plugin (this was already pretty old anyway)
    - FInvsee (might cause problems for moderation)
    - WorldGuard (areas usually protected, like spawn, may become vulnerable to block griefing)
    - Other interfaces/APIs that I probably forgot about
    - Pets (ElitePets)

Can't wait for all the bugs!
